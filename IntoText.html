<p>The aim of the JSNA is to collaboratively identify current and future health and wellbeing needs to inform future service planning and delivery. This profile contains a range of socio-economic, health, care and wellbeing related data, which provide a detailed assessment of current need and service activity at a local level. In addition to data relating to the selected area, information is provided for the hierarchy that the area is within.</p>
<p>This profile contains indicators on population, deprivation, children and young people, uptake of benefits, health-related behaviour, and health and care activity and outcomes.  Except for modelled data, rates are not available for counts of less than five. These are marked with a &#8216;#&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This report was created by the Devon Public Health Intelligence Team with assistance from colleagues across the County Council, Careers South West, Babcock LDP, NEW Devon CCG and the Devon Partnership Trust.</p>
