# jsna
Some of the summary datasets used in Devon County Council's Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA).

We're experimentimg with different ways of sharing and displaying the JSNA, ranging from the full PDF reports with detailed charts and narrative that we publish on the website, to raw datasets (with some early samples currently held in this repository) and interactive web maps and dashboards that we hope to begin developing later this year.

We'd welcome your feedback on these early explorations, let us know what data and which formats would be most helpful to you. To contact us you can raise an issue or send an email to lucy.knight@devon.gov.uk.
